Repository for the creation of an automated weather forecast based on station forecast data.

Current version: v0.1.6

## Features
The scripts will create forecast information bases on the given input and the api method that is called.
Initially there will be two types of forecast available:
  * a general weather forecast for a given location for the specified day with the default information
    * minimal/maximal air temperature for the day
    * wind information
    * rain information
    * air pressure information
  * a specified bicycle suggestion, if it is feasible to drive to work by bike today
    * serveral special limitations apply like start time, end time

## Usage
```
script usage: ruby <script> [parameters] <filename>
help usage :              ruby <script> (-h | --help)
help usage for parameter: ruby <script> <parameter> (-h | --help)
WRF forecast help:
 -h, --help     show help text
 -v, --version  prints the current version of the project
 -d, --date     argument: <date>; specifies the start_date of the requested forecast
     --default  runs the script with date as today at midnight and a 24 h forecast period
 -o, --offset   argument: <offset>; specifies how many hours from the forecast should be skipped
 -p, --period   argument: <period>; specifies the forecast period
 -w, --warning  adds an additional text section containing warnings and significant weather
```
When using this as a gem the main entry point is passing the arguments to the main module:
```
WrfForecast.initialize(['--default', '-o', '6', "../files/Ber.d01.TS"])
```

## Examples
Reading a file with 24 h forecast data and creating a forecast with default parameters
```
ruby wrf_forecast.rb --default <filename>
```
will lead to a forecast text like this:
```
Weather forecast of Hannover for the 2020-03-30 00:00:00 +0200.

Today will be a cold day. The maximum temperature will reach up to 16 degrees celsius. The minimum temperature will be -1 degrees celsius.
The wind will be normal and will reach up to 24 km/h from northeast. The mean wind will be 17 km/h.
The forecast does not predict rain.
```
When using the parameter `-w` or `--warning` the forecast text will be extended by a warning section:
```
Weather forecast of Berlin-Sch√∂neberg for the 2020-05-16 00:00:00 +0200.

Today will be a normal day. The maximum temperature will reach up to 18 degrees celsius. The minimum temperature will be 6 degrees celsius.
The wind will be normal and will reach up to 25 km/h from west. The mean wind will be 15 km/h.
The forecast does predict normal rain with a maximum of 0.1 mm in 1 hour and up to 1 mm for the day. There are some dry periods during the day.

Warnings: -
